# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide. Then use findings to create "PlanMyTrip" which will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients’ weather preferences. 

## Resources

Data Source: PyBer_ride_data.csv 
Software: Python 3.6.1 and Jupyter Notebook
Google Maps and Places API

## Project Summary

Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world’s unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

1. Collect the data.
2. Create Exploratory Analysis with Visualization.
- Create scatter plots of the weather data for the following comparisons:
    - Latitude versus temperature
    
    - Latitude versus humidity
     
    - Latitude versus cloudiness
    
    - Latitude versus wind speed
- Determine the correlations for the following weather data:
    - Latitude and temperature
    
    - Latitude and humidity
    
    - Latitude and cloudiness
    
    - Latitude and wind speed
- Create a series of heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API that showcases the following:
    - Latitude and temperature
    
    - Latitude and humidity
    
    - Latitude and cloudiness
    
    - Latitude and wind speed
3. Visualize Travel Data. 
- Create a heatmap with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer’s travel preferences.
    
## Challenge Overview

Implement the feedback from the Beta testers.

1. A weather description to the pop-up markers for customers so that they know what the weather is as they are traveling.

2. A notation in the search criteria to indicate if it is raining or snowing for customers who are making travel decisions in real-time.

3. A map that shows the directions for customers’ travel itinerary.
